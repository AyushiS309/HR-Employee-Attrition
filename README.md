💼 HR Employee Attrition Analysis

🔍 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using HR data. It aims to uncover key factors behind why employees leave an organization and support HR teams with data-driven insights.

🎯 Objectives
- Understand patterns related to employee attrition.
- Build machine learning models to predict which employees are likely to leave.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention.

📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed HR data.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Derived insights to support HR strategies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI / Streamlit (for dashboard and visualization)
- GitHub (for version control)

📁 Dataset
- **Source:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset  
- **Records:** 1,470 employees with various HR-related features

✅ Outcome
- Identified top factors influencing attrition: low job satisfaction, poor work-life balance, and low income.
- Built models with up to ~85% accuracy.
- Delivered strategic insights to help HR reduce turnover.
